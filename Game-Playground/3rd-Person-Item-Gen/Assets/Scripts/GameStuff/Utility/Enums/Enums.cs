//  All Enums in one place. Hate it when I have to go looking for an Enum and it is buried under a class.
//  I actually did this first because it gave me clues to the polymorphic Interfaces I could use.
//  I like to look at every property and play the "____ is a ____." and "_____ has a _____." 
//  Eventhough I want to not use a lot of inheritance, this feels like a good way to start to try and 
//  determine what design pattern I will try to follow. */
